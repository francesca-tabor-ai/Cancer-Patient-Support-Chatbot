# EU AI Act & Healthcare Compliance Research

## EU AI Act Key Requirements for Healthcare AI

### High-Risk AI System Classification
- **Scope**: Healthcare chatbots providing medical information are likely classified as high-risk AI systems under Annex III
- **Criteria**: AI systems that could materially influence healthcare decisions or patient outcomes
- **Exceptions**: Systems that perform narrow procedural tasks, improve previous human activities, or are preparatory may not be high-risk

### Mandatory Requirements for High-Risk AI Systems (Articles 8-17)

1. **Risk Management System**
   - Establish and maintain throughout AI system lifecycle
   - Identify, analyze, and mitigate risks
   - Document risk assessments and mitigation strategies

2. **Data Governance (Article 10)**
   - Training, validation, and testing datasets must be:
     - Relevant to intended purpose
     - Sufficiently representative
     - Free of errors and complete
     - Documented and traceable

3. **Technical Documentation (Article 11)**
   - Demonstrate compliance with all requirements
   - Enable authorities to assess compliance
   - Include system design, training data, performance metrics

4. **Record-Keeping (Article 12)**
   - Automatic recording of events relevant to:
     - Identifying national-level risks
     - Tracking substantial modifications
     - Audit trail for compliance verification

5. **Transparency & Information Provision (Article 13)**
   - Clear disclosure to users that they're interacting with AI
   - Explanation of AI system's capabilities and limitations
   - Information about decision-making processes
   - Disclaimer that AI is not a substitute for professional medical advice

6. **Human Oversight (Article 14)**
   - Design system to allow human intervention
   - Escalation mechanisms to medical professionals
   - Ability to override or reject AI recommendations
   - Human review of critical decisions

7. **Accuracy, Robustness & Cybersecurity (Article 15)**
   - Appropriate accuracy levels for intended use
   - Robustness against adversarial attacks
   - Cybersecurity measures to prevent unauthorized access
   - Regular testing and monitoring

8. **Quality Management System**
   - Procedures for compliance assurance
   - Documentation and record-keeping
   - Incident reporting mechanisms

## GDPR Requirements for Healthcare Data

### Special Categories of Data (Article 9)
- Health data is "special category" requiring heightened protection
- **Default**: Processing prohibited unless explicit legal basis exists

### Legal Bases for Healthcare AI
1. **Explicit Consent** (Article 9(2)(a))
   - Patient must give informed, specific consent
   - Can be withdrawn at any time
   - Separate consent for AI processing vs. standard care

2. **Health Professional Processing** (Article 9(2)(h))
   - Processing by/under responsibility of health professional
   - Subject to professional secrecy obligations
   - Must be necessary for medical diagnosis, care, or treatment

3. **Public Health Interest** (Article 9(2)(i))
   - Processing for public health protection
   - Requires appropriate safeguards
   - Must respect professional secrecy

### Key GDPR Obligations
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect data necessary for stated purpose
- **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for specified purposes
- **Storage Limitation**: Retain data only as long as necessary
- **Integrity & Confidentiality**: Secure processing and storage
- **Accountability**: Document compliance and decision-making
- **Data Subject Rights**: Provide access, correction, deletion rights

## Transparency & Informed Consent Requirements

### Disclosure Obligations
- Patients must be informed that AI is being used
- Explain what the AI does and its limitations
- Provide information about data use and storage
- Clear disclaimers about medical advice limitations
- Information about human oversight mechanisms

### Informed Consent for Medical AI
- Separate from standard medical consent
- Must be specific to AI use
- Patients must understand:
  - AI is not a substitute for professional judgment
  - Potential risks and benefits
  - How their data will be used
  - Their rights regarding AI decisions

### Human Oversight Requirements
- Medical professionals must review AI recommendations
- Escalation pathways to qualified healthcare staff
- Ability to override AI decisions
- Patient access to human review upon request

## Compliance Framework for Cancer Patient Chatbot

### Classification
- **Risk Level**: High-risk AI system (provides health information affecting patient decisions)
- **Regulatory Framework**: EU AI Act + GDPR + National Healthcare Laws

### Core Compliance Elements
1. Risk management system with documented assessments
2. Data governance policies and procedures
3. Technical documentation and system design records
4. Audit logging and record-keeping
5. Transparency disclosures and consent mechanisms
6. Human oversight and escalation procedures
7. Accuracy and robustness testing
8. Cybersecurity and data protection measures
9. Quality management system
10. Incident reporting procedures

### Patient Safeguards
- Clear AI disclosure on every interaction
- Medical disclaimer on all health information
- Easy escalation to human medical staff
- Consent management for data processing
- Access to personal data and decision logs
- Right to human review of recommendations

## Implementation Priorities
1. Establish governance structure and accountability
2. Implement comprehensive audit logging
3. Build consent and transparency mechanisms
4. Create escalation pathways to medical staff
5. Develop risk management procedures
6. Document all technical decisions and data sources
7. Implement cybersecurity and data protection
8. Create user-facing compliance documentation
